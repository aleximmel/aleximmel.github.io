            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Living in three different continents, four countries, three states, and seven cities in the span of twenty one years can be overwhelming for most, but for me, it has been an exciting challenge. From starting my life in the chaotic city of Tokyo, to finding Miami University deep in the cornfields of Ohio, I have quickly learned to adapt and relish my environment to impact the people around me.<br><br>Three things you should know about me are that I am a motivated leader, genuine character, and expert versatilist (Yes, I made up that word). I pride myself on certain intangible skills like my "figure-it-out" mentality, my constant desire to learn and grow, my ability to thrive amidst ambiguity, and my natural abilities to facilitate collaboration on a team and bring out the best from everyone around me.<br><br>I am passionate about startup and social entrepreneurship and jump on any opportunity to expose myself to that exciting world. Currently, however, I am switching gears by dipping my feet into the corporate world and spending my summer interning in the sales department of NBC 5 Chicago.<br><br>I've grown exponentially in the past few months and I can attribute that to the willingness I have to step out of my comfort zone and learn new things. I'm proud of the quality work I've recently produced and excited to see where I'll be next!</p>
